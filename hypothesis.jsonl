{"id":"H001","assumption":"MHC presentation proportionality assumption: Current immunology assumes MHC peptide presentation is primarily driven by protein abundance and random processing","hypothesis":"Structural Determinism Hypothesis: MHC presentation bias is systematically determined by intrinsic protein structural features (disorder propensity, degradation motifs, subcellular localization signals) rather than abundance, creating predictable 'visibility classes' of proteins","impact":"Would reshape understanding of immune surveillance, enable rational vaccine design, and explain why certain cancers/pathogens consistently escape detection","timestamp":"2025-08-25T23:23:35.000Z","status":"testable"}
{"id":"H002","assumption":"Size-agnostic processing assumption: Current literature assumes all proteins, regardless of size, are equally likely to contribute peptides per unit mass","hypothesis":"Micro-protein Invisibility Hypothesis: Small proteins (<100 amino acids) and cryptic ORFs are systematically under-represented in MHC presentation despite high expression, due to insufficient proteasomal processing sites and rapid degradation kinetics","impact":"Would reveal a blind spot in immune surveillance affecting viral immune evasion, tumor neoantigens, and autoimmunity, opening new therapeutic targets","timestamp":"2025-08-25T23:23:35.000Z","status":"testable"}
{"id":"H003","assumption":"Uniform tissue representation assumption: Immunopeptidome studies assume findings from easily accessible tissues represent universal presentation patterns","hypothesis":"Tissue-Specific Antigenome Hypothesis: Each tissue type has a fundamentally different 'antigenome signature' based on unique proteasomal activity, stress responses, and metabolic states, making current broad generalizations invalid","impact":"Would transform precision immunotherapy by requiring tissue-specific targeting strategies and explain differential autoimmune susceptibilities","timestamp":"2025-08-25T23:23:35.000Z","status":"testable"}
{"id":"H004","assumption":"Static presentation assumption: Current models treat MHC presentation as relatively stable across cellular states","hypothesis":"Dynamic Stress-Response Antigenome Hypothesis: Cellular stress fundamentally rewires the antigenome by altering proteasomal targeting, revealing normally 'invisible' proteins and creating temporal windows of immune vulnerability/opportunity","impact":"Would enable timing-based therapeutic interventions and explain why immune responses vary with disease progression and treatment","timestamp":"2025-08-25T23:23:35.000Z","status":"testable"}
