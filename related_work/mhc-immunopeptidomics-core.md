# Core MHC Immunopeptidomics Research

## Foundational Papers on MHC Class I Presentation

### Problem Framework
- **Problem**: Understanding which proteins are presented on MHC molecules and why some are systematically under/over-represented
- **Core Assumption**: MHC presentation is primarily determined by protein degradation pathways and binding affinity
- **Gap**: Limited understanding of systematic biases in protein representation

## Biological Mechanisms

### Protein Degradation Pathways

**Mamrosh et al. (2023) - Degradation Pathway Requirements**
- **Core Finding**: 30% of MHC peptides are UPS-independent (enriched in mitochondrial origin)
- **Key Assumption Challenged**: All MHC peptides require ubiquitin-proteasome system
- **Technical Approach**: Systematic inhibition of degradation pathways
- **Impact**: Reveals alternative pathways for antigen generation

### Proteasomal Processing

**Mishto et al. (2024) - Proteasome Peptide Splicing**
- **Innovation**: Workflow to analyze both non-spliced and spliced peptides
- **Key Finding**: 20S proteasomes produce sizeable variety of cis-spliced peptides
- **Assumption Challenged**: Proteasomes only perform hydrolysis
- **Impact**: Expands understanding of antigen processing complexity

## Clinical Implications

### Tissue-Specific Patterns

**Hardy et al. (2021) - Non-canonical Protein Contribution**
- **Core Finding**: 28% of non-canonical proteins are novel isoforms, 72% are cryptic proteins
- **Key Insight**: Cryptic proteins generate MHC-I peptides 5-fold more efficiently
- **Clinical Relevance**: Novel targets for immunotherapy
- **Impact**: Challenges conventional proteome annotation

### Biomarker Discovery

**Balakrishnan et al. (2025) - ncRNA Peptides and EVs**
- **Innovation**: Focus on non-coding RNA-derived peptides in extracellular vesicles
- **Key Finding**: EVs transport ncRNA-derived peptides for systemic distribution
- **Clinical Application**: Potential for diagnostic and therapeutic applications
- **Impact**: Novel pathway for immune surveillance modulation

## Common Assumptions Across Literature

1. **Protein abundance correlates with presentation** - Frequently challenged
2. **Proteasomal degradation is the primary source** - 30% are UPS-independent
3. **Only canonical proteins contribute significantly** - Non-canonical proteins over-represented
4. **Presentation is primarily allele-specific** - Tissue-specific patterns exist
5. **Mass spectrometry captures complete immunopeptidome** - Technical limitations persist

## Research Gaps Identified

1. **Systematic protein bias quantification** - Need for comprehensive scoring systems
2. **Integration of protein properties** - Stability, localization, turnover rates
3. **Non-canonical source integration** - Small ORFs, alternative frames
4. **Clinical translation** - From discovery to therapeutic applications
5. **Cross-tissue comparative studies** - Standardized methodologies needed
