# Experiment Ideas

## Core Experiments
1. **Experiment Name**
   - Objective: What you aim to prove
   - Method: Your approach and methodology
   - Success: Target metric and threshold

2. **Experiment Name**

## Ablations
- Remove component: Expected impact on results
- Modify parameter: Expected change in behavior

## Baselines
- Baseline method 1: Expected performance level
- State-of-the-art method: How we compare

## Priority
**Must have:** Critical experiments for validation
**Nice to have:** Additional experiments for robustness
