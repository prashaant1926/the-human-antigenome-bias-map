## Research Philosophy

This project challenges fundamental assumptions about MHC presentation through systematic hypothesis testing, following Stanford's literature-level hypothesis methodology. Rather than building another descriptive tool, we aim to discover **why** certain proteins are immunologically invisible and reshape understanding of immune surveillance.

## Core Research Hypotheses

### H001: Structural Determinism Hypothesis
**Assumption to Challenge:** Current immunology assumes MHC presentation is primarily driven by protein abundance and random processing.

**Novel Hypothesis:** MHC presentation bias is systematically determined by intrinsic protein structural features (disorder propensity, degradation motifs, subcellular localization) rather than abundance, creating predictable 'visibility classes.'

**Impact:** Would reshape immune surveillance understanding, enable rational vaccine design, explain consistent pathogen immune evasion.

### H002: Micro-protein Invisibility Hypothesis  
**Assumption to Challenge:** All proteins are equally likely to contribute peptides per unit mass regardless of size.

**Novel Hypothesis:** Small proteins (<100 amino acids) and cryptic ORFs are systematically under-represented despite high expression, due to insufficient proteasomal processing sites and rapid degradation kinetics.

**Impact:** Would reveal immune surveillance blind spots affecting viral evasion, tumor neoantigens, autoimmunity.

### H003: Tissue-Specific Antigenome Hypothesis
**Assumption to Challenge:** Immunopeptidome findings from accessible tissues represent universal patterns.

**Novel Hypothesis:** Each tissue has fundamentally different 'antigenome signatures' based on unique proteasomal activity, stress responses, metabolic states.

**Impact:** Would transform precision immunotherapy requiring tissue-specific strategies.

### H004: Dynamic Stress-Response Antigenome Hypothesis
**Assumption to Challenge:** MHC presentation remains relatively stable across cellular states.

**Novel Hypothesis:** Cellular stress fundamentally rewires the antigenome by altering proteasomal targeting, revealing normally 'invisible' proteins.

**Impact:** Would enable timing-based interventions, explain variable immune responses.

## Methodological Approach

### Phase 1: Establish the Priors
- Systematic literature review identifying implicit assumptions about MHC presentation
- Map contradictions and gaps in current models
- Document tissue-specific and context-dependent findings

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Testing Framework
1. **Data Integration**: Collect comprehensive MHC peptide datasets across tissues, conditions, disease states
2. **Structural Analysis**: Integrate protein disorder, degradation signals, localization predictions
3. **Bias Quantification**: Calculate presentation scores normalized for abundance, size, turnover
4. **Pattern Discovery**: Machine learning to identify structural determinants of visibility classes
5. **Validation Experiments**: Design targeted experiments to test specific predictions

### Phase 3: Impact Validation
- Demonstrate how findings affect existing immunotherapy approaches  
- Show predictive power for vaccine design and immune evasion
- Validate tissue-specific and dynamic presentation patterns

## Research Vectoring Strategy

**Highest Risk Dimension:** The structural determinism hypothesis - if protein structure doesn't predict presentation bias better than abundance, the entire framework needs revision.

**Critical Validation:** Can we predict which proteins will be over/under-represented based solely on structural features, independent of abundance data?

**Failure Modes:** 
- If patterns are purely stochastic (no structural determinism)
- If tissue differences are minimal (no tissue specificity)  
- If dynamic changes are marginal (no stress rewiring)

## Expected Deliverables

### Immediate Outputs
- Comprehensive human antigenome bias map with mechanistic explanations
- Predictive models for protein visibility based on structural features
- Tissue-specific antigenome signatures
- Dynamic presentation patterns under cellular stress

### Long-term Impact
- Paradigm shift from abundance-based to structure-based understanding of immune presentation
- Rational design principles for vaccines targeting 'invisible' proteins
- Precision immunotherapy strategies based on tissue-specific antigenomes
- Temporal intervention windows based on dynamic presentation patterns

## Experimental Validation Pipeline

1. **Structural Predictions**: Test whether disorder/degradation motifs predict under-representation
2. **Size Effects**: Validate micro-protein invisibility through targeted MS analysis  
3. **Tissue Specificity**: Compare antigenomes across multiple tissue types
4. **Dynamic Changes**: Map presentation changes under defined stress conditions
5. **Therapeutic Validation**: Test predictions in relevant disease models
