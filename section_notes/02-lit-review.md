# Literature Review: The Human Antigenome Bias Map

## Overview

This literature review examines the current state of knowledge regarding systematic biases in MHC Class I presentation, integrating 27 papers from 2016-2025 across high-impact journals including Nature, Science, Cell, Nature Communications, and other leading venues. The review reveals consistent challenges to fundamental assumptions about protein visibility in immunopeptidomes and identifies critical research gaps that our project aims to address.

## Core Assumptions Challenged Across the Literature

### Assumption 1: Protein Abundance Determines Presentation
**Traditional View**: MHC presentation directly correlates with protein abundance  
**Evidence Against**: Kubiniok et al. (2022) demonstrated systematic, evolutionarily conserved tissue-specific patterns independent of abundance. Hardy et al. (2021) showed cryptic proteins generate peptides 5-fold more efficiently than canonical proteins despite lower abundance.

### Assumption 2: Structural Properties Are Irrelevant
**Traditional View**: Peptide sampling is purely sequence-driven  
**Evidence Against**: Perez et al. (2019) revealed enriched sampling of helical fragments in source proteins. Our systematic analysis identifies intrinsic disorder as a key determinant of degradation pathway selection (Pereira et al., 2024).

### Assumption 3: Canonical Proteins Dominate
**Traditional View**: Only protein-coding sequences contribute meaningfully  
**Evidence Against**: Multiple studies (Hardy et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2024) demonstrate that non-canonical sources are over-represented and clinically relevant, with 6 of 13 prioritized cancer neoantigens derived from non-canonical sources.

## Conclusion

This literature review of 27 high-quality papers from 2016-2025 reveals a paradigm shift away from abundance-based, random sampling models toward systematic, structure-determined, context-dependent understanding of MHC presentation. The consistent challenge to fundamental assumptions across multiple independent studies provides strong foundation for our hypothesis-driven research framework.

**Key Literature-Supported Insights:**
1. Protein structure systematically determines presentation bias
2. Non-canonical sources are over-represented and therapeutically relevant  
3. Tissue-specific and dynamic presentation patterns exist
4. Current prediction models miss critical determinants
