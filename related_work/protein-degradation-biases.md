# Protein Degradation and MHC Presentation Biases

## Core Research Question
Why are some proteins consistently over-represented while others are under-represented in MHC presentation, despite their cellular abundance?

## Key Mechanisms of Presentation Bias

### Proteasomal Processing Preferences

**Mamrosh et al. (2023) - Quantitative Pathway Analysis**
- **Core Finding**: 30% of MHC peptides are UPS-independent, enriched in mitochondrial proteins
- **Technical Innovation**: Systematic inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome system
- **Key Insight**: Alternative degradation pathways contribute significantly
- **Clinical Relevance**: Proteasome inhibitors alter presented peptide repertoire

**Mishto et al. (2024) - Proteasome Splicing Mechanisms**
- **Problem**: Understanding proteasomal peptide generation beyond simple hydrolysis
- **Key Finding**: 20S proteasomes catalyze both peptide splicing and hydrolysis
- **Technical Approach**: Full-length protein degradation analysis
- **Impact**: Reveals additional complexity in antigen processing

### Ribosome-Associated Quality Control

**Trentini et al. (2020) - Co-translational Surveillance**
- **Problem**: How nascent protein quality control affects MHC presentation
- **Core Finding**: Ribosome stalling leads to enhanced MHC presentation
- **Mechanism**: Ribosome-associated quality control targets defective proteins
- **Impact**: Links protein synthesis quality to immune surveillance

### Protein Stability Factors

**Kubiniok et al. (2022) - Constitutive Presentation Patterns**
- **Core Assumption Challenged**: Protein abundance determines presentation
- **Key Finding**: Systematic biases exist independent of expression levels
- **Technical Innovation**: Cross-tissue comparative immunopeptidomics
- **Impact**: Reveals intrinsic protein properties affecting presentation

## Factors Influencing Presentation Bias

### 1. Protein Localization
- **Mitochondrial proteins**: Over-represented despite UPS-independence
- **Nuclear proteins**: Variable presentation depending on degradation signals
- **Membrane proteins**: Often under-represented due to processing challenges

### 2. Protein Stability
- **Short-lived proteins**: Enhanced presentation through rapid turnover
- **Stable proteins**: Under-represented unless specifically targeted
- **Intrinsically disordered regions**: May facilitate proteasomal processing

### 3. Post-translational Modifications
- **Ubiquitination signals**: Direct proteasomal targeting
- **Phosphorylation**: Can modulate stability and degradation
- **Chemical modifications**: Alter proteolytic susceptibility

## Non-Canonical Sources Contributing to Bias

### Small ORF and Cryptic Proteins

**Hardy et al. (2021) - Non-canonical Proteome Analysis**
- **Key Finding**: Cryptic proteins generate MHC peptides 5-fold more efficiently than canonical proteins
- **Mechanism**: Lower stability and more disordered structure
- **Technical Approach**: Integrated RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and MS
- **Impact**: Redefines proteome contribution to immunopeptidome

**Chen et al. (2021) - sORF Discovery Pipeline**
- **Innovation**: Integrated approach combining Ribo-seq with MS-based validation
- **Key Result**: 308 noncanonical immunopeptides identified
- **Technical Challenge**: Accurate detection methods for small peptides
- **Clinical Relevance**: Novel immunotherapy targets

### Frameshifted Products

**Laumont et al. (2016) - Non-canonical Reading Frames**
- **Paradigm Shift**: Significant contribution from non-AUG initiated translation
- **Technical Innovation**: Proteogenomic approach using custom databases
- **Key Finding**: Pervasive translation outside annotated genes
- **Impact**: Expands understanding of antigen source diversity

## Implications for Immune Surveillance

### Evolutionary Conservation
- **Cross-species patterns**: Presentation biases are evolutionarily conserved
- **Functional significance**: Suggests important biological roles
- **Clinical translation**: Patterns may be preserved in disease states

### Disease Relevance
- **Cancer immunotherapy**: Biased presentation affects neoantigen visibility
- **Autoimmunity**: Self-protein presentation patterns influence tolerance
- **Infectious disease**: Pathogen protein processing follows similar rules

## Technical Challenges in Bias Quantification

### Current Limitations
1. **MS sensitivity**: Cannot capture complete immunopeptidome
2. **Quantification standards**: Lack of absolute quantification methods
3. **Tissue representation**: Limited availability of primary tissues
4. **Allele coverage**: Bias toward common HLA alleles

### Methodological Advances Needed
1. **Standardized bias metrics**: Consistent measurement across studies
2. **Predictive models**: Integration of multiple protein properties
3. **High-throughput validation**: Functional confirmation of predictions
4. **Clinical applicability**: Translation to therapeutic contexts

## Research Hypotheses Emerging

### Primary Hypotheses
1. **Protein stability hypothesis**: Short-lived proteins are over-represented
2. **Localization bias hypothesis**: Cellular compartmentalization affects presentation
3. **Processing efficiency hypothesis**: Proteasomal preferences create systematic biases
4. **Quality control hypothesis**: Defective proteins are preferentially presented

### Testable Predictions
1. Destabilizing mutations should increase protein presentation
2. Compartment-specific degradation should show distinct bias patterns
3. Proteasome inhibition should reveal alternative presentation pathways
4. Ribosome stalling should enhance antigen generation

## Clinical and Therapeutic Implications

### Vaccine Design
- **Target selection**: Focus on consistently presented proteins
- **Bias exploitation**: Leverage over-represented protein classes
- **Coverage optimization**: Account for under-represented targets

### Cancer Immunotherapy
- **Neoantigen prediction**: Include presentation bias in algorithms
- **Resistance mechanisms**: Under-representation may enable immune evasion
- **Combination strategies**: Target multiple bias categories

### Drug Development
- **Proteasome modulators**: Alter presentation landscapes therapeutically
- **Degradation enhancers**: Increase presentation of specific targets
- **Quality control inhibitors**: Enhance defective protein presentation
