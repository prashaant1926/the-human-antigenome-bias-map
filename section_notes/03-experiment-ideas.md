### Experiment 1: Structural Determinism Validation (H001)

**Thesis Statement:** Intrinsic protein structural features determine MHC presentation bias independent of protein abundance.

**Testable Hypotheses:**
- H1a: Proteins with high intrinsic disorder (>30% disordered regions) show 2-fold lower presentation rates when normalized for abundance
- H1b: Proteins with specific degradation motifs (PEST sequences, degrons) show predictable presentation patterns

**Dependent Variables (Measurements):**
- Presentation Index: (observed peptides/protein length) normalized by protein abundance
- Structural Disorder Score: % residues in disordered regions (IUPred2A)
- Degradation Signal Density: PEST motifs and degron count per 100 amino acids
- Localization Confidence: UniProt/HPA subcellular localization scores

**Independent Variables (Manipulations):**
- Protein structural class: ordered vs. disordered vs. mixed
- Degradation motif presence: high vs. low PEST density
- Subcellular compartment: 5 major localizations
- Tissue type: 8-12 representative human tissues

**Experimental Tasks/Procedures:**
1. Curate comprehensive MHC-I peptide datasets (IEDB, SysteMHC, tissue atlases)

5. Validate with independent test set (20% holdout)
6. Cross-validate across different MHC allotypes

**Validity Threats & Mitigations:**
